Arduino Uno sketch using the standard Wiznet Ethernet interface. You can access the setup
page from <Default IP>/setup, at which point you are able to setup networking info
as well as what Companion button you would like to trigger over OSC. By default it is monitoring 
Pin 2 to be pulled HIGH, and a rather long debounce time, which is all adjustable.
